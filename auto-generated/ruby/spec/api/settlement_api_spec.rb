#BitMEX API

### REST API for the BitMEX Trading Platform  [View Changelog](/app/apiChangelog)  -  #### Getting Started  Base URI: [https://www.bitmex.com/api/v1](/api/v1)  ##### Fetching Data  All REST endpoints are documented below. You can try out any query right from this interface.  Most table queries accept `count`, `start`, and `reverse` params. Set `reverse=true` to get rows newest-first.  Additional documentation regarding filters, timestamps, and authentication is available in [the main API documentation](/app/restAPI).  _All_ table data is available via the [Websocket](/app/wsAPI). We highly recommend using the socket if you want to have the quickest possible data without being subject to ratelimits.  ##### Return Types  By default, all data is returned as JSON. Send `?_format=csv` to get CSV data or `?_format=xml` to get XML data.  ##### Trade Data Queries  _This is only a small subset of what is available, to get you started._  Fill in the parameters and click the `Try it out!` button to try any of these queries.  - [Pricing Data](#!/Quote/Quote_get)  - [Trade Data](#!/Trade/Trade_get)  - [OrderBook Data](#!/OrderBook/OrderBook_getL2)  - [Settlement Data](#!/Settlement/Settlement_get)  - [Exchange Statistics](#!/Stats/Stats_history)  Every function of the BitMEX.com platform is exposed here and documented. Many more functions are available.  ##### Swagger Specification  [⇩ Download Swagger JSON](swagger.json)  -  ## All API Endpoints  Click to expand a section.

  # unit tests for settlement_get

  # @param [Hash] opts the optional parameters
  # @option opts [String] :symbol Instrument symbol. Send a bare series (e.g. XBT) to get data for the nearest expiring contract in that series.  You can also send a timeframe, e.g. &#x60;XBT:quarterly&#x60;. Timeframes are &#x60;nearest&#x60;, &#x60;daily&#x60;, &#x60;weekly&#x60;, &#x60;monthly&#x60;, &#x60;quarterly&#x60;, &#x60;biquarterly&#x60;, and &#x60;perpetual&#x60;.
  # @option opts [String] :filter Generic table filter. Send JSON key/value pairs, such as &#x60;{\&quot;key\&quot;: \&quot;value\&quot;}&#x60;. You can key on individual fields, and do more advanced querying on timestamps. See the [Timestamp Docs](https://www.bitmex.com/app/restAPI#Timestamp-Filters) for more details.
  # @option opts [String] :columns Array of column names to fetch. If omitted, will return all columns.  Note that this method will always return item keys, even when not specified, so you may receive more columns that you expect.
  # @option opts [Float] :count Number of results to fetch.
  # @option opts [Float] :start Starting point for results.
  # @option opts [BOOLEAN] :reverse If true, will sort results newest first.
  # @option opts [DateTime] :start_time Starting date filter for results.
  # @option opts [DateTime] :end_time Ending date filter for results.
  # @return [Array<Settlement>]
